### **Joseph Atemia**  
#### Bioinformatics Researcher | PhD in Bioinformatics | Computational Biologist  

👋 Hi there! I’m a passionate bioinformatics researcher with a strong background in computational biology, next-generation sequencing (NGS), and data visualization. I recently completed my PhD at Heinrich Heine University Düsseldorf, where I focused on leveraging bioinformatics tools to study genetic diversity and adaptation in teosinte, a wild maize relative. I’m now seeking new challenges to apply and expand my expertise in a dynamic research or industry setting.  

🔬 **Research Interests**:  
- NGS Genomics 
- Population genetics and phylogenetics  
- Genome-wide association studies (GWAS)  
- RNA-Seq data processing and analysis  
- Development of bioinformatics tools for genomics
- Machine Learning  

---

### **🛠️ Technical Skills**  
- **Programming Languages**: Python, R, Bash  
- **Computing Tools**: SLURM, Sun Grid Engine, Git  
- **NGS Analysis**: Whole genome/transcriptome alignment, assembly, annotation, variant calling  
- **Statistical Analysis**: Linear/mixed models, classical statistics, multivariate analysis  
- **Benchwork**: DNA/RNA extraction, quantification, PCR amplification  
<!--- **Teaching & Mentorship**: Conducted workshops and mentored students in bioinformatics and statistics  --->
